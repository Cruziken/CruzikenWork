Exercise 6 (FizzBuzz with OO concepts)

Step 1: 
<p>Read off an INI file with the following format </p>
<ul>
  <li> max_int = In this case key = 100 </li>
  <li>lower_divisor = In this case key = 3 </li>
  <li>upper_divisor = In this case key = 5 </li>
  <li>lower_divisor_label = In this case key = fizz </li>
  <li>upper_divisor_label = In this case key = buzz </li>
</ul>
Step 2: <br />
Print the integers 1-max_int, unless...<br />
<ul>
<li>If the integer is divisible by lower_divisor, print lower_divisor_label instead of the integer.</li>
<li>If the integer is divisible by upper_divisor, print upper_divisor_label instead.</li>
<li>If it is divisible by both lower_divisor and upper_divisor, print lower_divisor_label+upper_divisor_label.</li>

Step 3: 
<p>In addition to printing the output, store it in a log file named log_.text</p>
